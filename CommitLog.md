# Current Focus

Added but have yet to fully check:

1. Current tecnique to handle it: Using "runs" [To check and confirm later when
   drilling down to breaking into single node due to metadata]
2. Alignment such as mid and end have been added
3. Image can be captured as well
4. Page break [To check and modify accordingly so that we know if it is empty
   paragraph or page break. This is not fully done yet]

Current Focus for next commit:

1. Line break to be done
2. Font type to be consistent
3. Font color

## Future

1. Footer: not registering page number

2. metadata of paragraph

   - Font type
   - Font Color
   - Highlighting
   - bullet point
   - indented text
   - Numbered list

3. Format & structure of the node
